## Github login ssh file configuration

Sometimes the only ssh port allowed is 443 rather than 22. Add following configuration to the ssh config file (~/.ssh/config):

```
Host github.com
Hostname ssh.github.com
Port 443
User git
```

Now you can use `ssh -T git@github.com` to test the connection.

To automatically login to github on shell startup:
* create a key pair with tools like `ssh-keygen` , change its permission to 700 (see the ssh chapter for details)
* on github website, add a new ssh key in SSH and GPG keys settings, and paste the public key in
* add the following command to shell startup script. Remember to change the path to suit your case. for example my secret key is located at `~/.ssh/github-login` then the command becomes `ssh-add ~/.ssh/github-login` .
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add <path to the private key file>
```

Now restart the shell to let the script take effect.

## Zsh

Zsh, of course, has different startup files than Bash. Roughly `~/.zshrc` corresponds to `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zlogin` corresponds to `~/.login_profile`.

## X11-forwarding from remote rootless docker container?

I didn't find a secure and rootless way to do this, but some links here might be useful:

Some workaround on authentication that looks dangerous:

 `--ipc host` looks related to x11 forwarding (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38907708/docker-ipc-host-and-security) but it can cause permission issue when it's rootless (https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/36674). In my case this option leads to something like this:

```
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: error mounting "mqueue" to rootfs at "/dev/mqueue": mount mqueue:/dev/mqueue ...(omitted)
```
